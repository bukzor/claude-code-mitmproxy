# Todo

Use subtasks, not sections for organization. Ordered by intended completion.
Narrative in `../session.kb/`.

- [x] <https:todo.kb/2026-08-10-000-Session-specific-guidance-bullets-are-unruled-core-digest-noise.md>
- [x] Promote a `long-form` fixture at v2.1.226. Done — the haiku
      capture, unsuffixed, once `masks.d/knowledge-cutoff.md` proved
      haiku and sonnet long-form are the same copy (their v2.1.215 cores
      differed by that one line and nothing else).
- [ ] Reconcile `v2.1.226.md`'s tools bullet when a sonnet long-form
      capture at that version shows up. The promoted body says "Prefer
      dedicated tools over PowerShell ... (Read, Edit, Write, Glob,
      Grep)" while its own `# Environment` says `Shell: bash`, and all 20
      other captures on disk say Bash and list only Read/Edit/Write.
      Either upstream A/B'd a reworded bullet with the shell name
      mis-substituted, or the rewording is real and the shell name is a
      bug. A second 2.1.226 long-form capture settles it; until then the
      fixture carries a sample of one.
- [x] Decide whether `git-status` should strip a commit-less repo. Yes,
      and the fix was one character: `$LINES` now matches zero or more
      lines. The miss was never in `blocks.d/git-status.md` — its
      `$GITLOG` is a DEFAULT hole — but in `masks.d/git-log.md`, whose
      `$GITLOGLINES` could not match the empty region a fresh repo sends.
      Not a third hole type, just the same one with its count relaxed; the
      blank-line bound is untouched, and writing the placeholder's name in
      where nothing was is the coarsening masks want. All five checkers
      byte-identical except the survey, which gained four rows: cores
      27 → 23, unpromoted 21 → 17.
